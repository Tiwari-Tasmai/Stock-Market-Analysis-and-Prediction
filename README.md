Deep learning is used to train the proposed model using the LSTM algorithm in this model. An algorithm known as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) employs a time-series mechanism for character analysis in order to efficiently train a model for future predictions and performance.

By providing a feedback mechanism to guarantee the security of data, LSTM advances the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) concept. The proposed model has been tested for prediction with a variety of single-day and consecutive-day values. It is able to take in a variety of fluctuating data values either manually or through the API (Application Programming Interface). However, the accuracy over a two-day time series was the most accurate. The LSTM model that we proposed is capable of effectively analyzing and extracting the features of the feeding input and performs well over any kind of fluctuating data, as shown by the experimental results.
